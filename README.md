Hi Techies, 
This is my latest project called Human Emotion Detection. In this project I have trained images based on four emotional categories,i.e, fear, sad, smile and neutral.
The model is trained using YoloV3(You Only Look Once) Algorithm. I have used "LabelImg" for labeling different classes used in this model. I have also used text to speech conversion in this project with the help of "pyttsx3". After detecting the image based on the image emotion class the "pyttsx3" will convert the text to speech format.
